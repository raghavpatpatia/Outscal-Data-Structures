# Priority Queue Class using Linked List Implementation

## Description
This Priority Queue Class is implemented using a Linked List to store elements with associated priorities. It provides the following functions:

- `push(int element, int priority)`: Inserts an element with the given priority into the priority queue.
- `pop()`: Deletes the topmost element having the maximum priority.
- `front()`: Returns the topmost element having the maximum priority without removing it.

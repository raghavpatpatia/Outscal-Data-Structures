# Chapter 21 - Implementation - 2 - Deque using Doubly Linked List

## Task

Implement a Deque (Double-Ended Queue) class using a doubly linked list (or linked list) in your preferred programming language. The Deque should support the following functions:

- `insertFront(int x)`: Adds an item at the front of the Deque.
- `insertRear(int x)`: Adds an item at the rear of the Deque.
- `deleteFront()`: Deletes an item from the front of the Deque.
- `deleteRear()`: Deletes an item from the rear of the Deque.
- `getFront()`: Gets the front item from the Deque.
- `getRear()`: Gets the last item from the Deque.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks whether the Deque is empty or not.

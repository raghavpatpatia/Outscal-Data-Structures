# Priority Queue Implementation using Array

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a Priority Queue using an array-based implementation of a queue. A Priority Queue is a data structure that allows you to insert elements with associated priorities and efficiently retrieve and remove the element with the highest priority.

## Implementation Details

### Functions

1. `push(int element, int priority)`: Inserts an element with the given priority into the priority queue.

2. `pop()`: Deletes the topmost element with the maximum priority.

3. `front()`: Returns the topmost element with the maximum priority without removing it.
